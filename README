bLSM uses several 3rd party open source libraries and tools.

This file summarizes the tools used, their purpose, and the licenses
under which they're released.  Portions of bLSM are based upon Stasis'
"Rose" LSM-Tree implementation.

Except as specifically stated below, the 3rd party software packages
listed below are not distributed as part of this project, but instead
are separately downloaded from the respective provider and built on
the developerâ€™s machine as a pre-build step.

bLSM relies upon Stasis, a transactional storage library written and
maintained by the authors of bLSM.

bLSM includes an example MapKeeper-compatible storage server, which
relies upon the MapKeeper prototocol specification, which we also
maintain:

The generated MapKeeper files (and, therefore the bLSM MapKeeper
bindings) also require Thrift and Boost.

Thrift is a serialization and RPC framework:

Boost is a collection of utility libraries for C++:
